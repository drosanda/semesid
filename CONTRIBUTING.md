# Contributing to Seme Framework

Seme Framework created not to make you confused, but if you need _OFF ROAD_ way Seme Framework is your answer.

If you have any ideas, every contribution is welcome; either by [reporting a bug](https://github.com/drosanda/seme-framework/issues/new?labels=Bug+Report&template=bug_report.md) or [suggesting improvements](https://github.com/drosanda/seme-framework/issues/new?labels=Change+Request&template=feature_request.md), or in a more active form like [requesting a pull](https://github.com/drosanda/seme-framework/pulls).

We want to create lightweight PHP MVC Framework. Thus, below are some guidelines that we expect to be followed by each contributor:

- **Be brief, but be bold**. State your issues briefly. But speak out your ideas loudly, even if you can't or don't know how to implement them right away. The world will be better with limitless innovations.
- **Follow PHP-FIG standards**. We follow PHP Standards Recommendations (PSRs) by [PHP Framework Interoperability Group](http://www.php-fig.org/). If you're not familiar with these standards, [familiarize yourself now](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards). Also, please run `composer fix` to automatically fix your code to match these recommendations.
- **Test your code**. No one knows your code better than you, so we depend on you to test the changes you make before pull request submission. We use [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for our testing purposes and request that you use this tool too. Tests can be ran with `composer test`. [Documentation for writing tests with PHPUnit is available on Read the Docs.](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io)
- **Use best practices when submitting pull requests**. Create a separate branch named specifically for the issue that you are addressing. Read the [GitHub manual](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) to learn more about pull requests and GitHub. If you are new to GitHub, read [this short manual](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to get yourself familiar with forks and how git works in general. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zvHQXnBO6c) explains how to synchronize your fork on GitHub with the upstream branch from PHPWord.
